# emoji-prediction-lstm
his project showcases the implementation of a machine learning model to predict emojis based on input text. Leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and pre-trained word embeddings, the model accurately associates text with corresponding emojis, offering a fun and practical application of natural language processing.
